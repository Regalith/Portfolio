			"Built a system for synconizing player reticle and shot data as nDisplay events across all connected nDisplay nodes",
			"Helped solve the myriad of gameplay bugs existing in the project when I joined",
			"Set up a functional testing framework plugin that would have been far more useful before they started development",
			"Created a system to deproject from real world screen space to 3D world space that took into account nDisplay's vertex shaders and phyically curved screens",
			"Built tools to tune this deprojection on site given that there was a disconnect between real world measurements and the 3D representation in game"

			"Synced up the disconnect between nDisplay's rendering output and needed engine functions that were still using the unmodified camera data",
			"Setup nDisplay configs to load from files to allow for camera tuning on site",
			"Converted the Alterface module I wrote to an Unreal Plugin to make it easier to move between projects",
			"Built a hierarchy of sound classes that could be dynamically modified live on site for sound balancing via an in-game menu and json files",
			"Created vertex shader to simulate roiling lava in scenes",
			"Wrote the jankiest version of pathfinding for flying enemies to navigate through scenes dynamically"

A puppeteer would wear a Dynamixyz face tracking headset that would drive blendshapes on the panda’s face to allow the panda to talk and match facial expressions of the puppeteer. A live camera feed of the room where the exhibit was in was displayed along with a large amount of movement controls to allow the puppeteer to interact directly with the people watching the screen.",
